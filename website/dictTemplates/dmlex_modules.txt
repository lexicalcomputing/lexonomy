When an object - such as an entry or a sense - is a member of several relations (for example: when a sense is a member of a synonymy relation and also of an antonymy relation) then, when showing the object (the entry or the sense) to human users, the relations should be listed in this order (for example: the synonyms first, the antonyms second)."
placeholder: ! "Marks up a substring inside a headword or inside a headword translation which is not part of the expression itself but stands for things that can take its place.
